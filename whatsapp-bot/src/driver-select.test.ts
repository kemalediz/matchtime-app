/**
 * `WA_DRIVER` is the rollback, so it has to be boring and loud.
 *
 * Boring: unset means whatsapp-web.js, which is what the Pi has always
 * run, so merging Phase 2 changes nothing about how the bot starts.
 *
 * Loud: an unrecognised value throws. On the cutover morning (plan
 * Phase 6) somebody sets this variable on a Pi over SSH before a fixture,
 * and "it started fine" must not be able to mean "it started fine on the
 * library you were trying to leave".
